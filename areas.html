                           <p>
                              Criminal law involves government prosecution of an individual for an act that is classified as a crime. Criminal cases are tried through a state prosecutor who initiates the criminal law case by bringing charges against an individual. Individuals who are convicted of a crime may be incarcerated, fined, or a combination of both.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              The best hope in a criminal case is to have a Criminal Attorney every step of the way to ensure that your rights are protected and to secure the best possible outcome for your case. Criminal Defense Attorneys know what the best case and worst case scenarios are and properly advise you of your legal rights based on the crime you have committed. If you don't use a criminal defense attorney, you could be jeopardizing your future and the severity of the punishment you could receive.

                              Before you enter into any business contract or any type of written contract it is always important to have it reviewed by an Attorney to ensure you fully understand the terms and conditions you are binding yourself to. Once an individual enters into a Contract that law presumes that you fully understood and agreed with the terms of same even if you didn’t. Often times, we have clients that come to us seeking assistance to terminate a Contract they entered into but did not fully represent their interests and wishes. Although we have been very successfully in invalidating and/or amending Contracts, it is far less expensive to have an experienced attorney either draft or review a contract prior to you signing it then it is to litigate a contract that was poorly drafted.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              If you do find yourself in a contract that you either want to enforce, or is being enforced against you, at Angulo Diaz Law Group, P.A we will provide you with the expert help you need. We work closely with our clients and our first objective is try to resolve the issue without expensive litigation. But where litigation is unavoidable, we are fearless in enforcing and/or defending our client’s rights.

                              Florida Real Estate laws are complex and cover a broad range of issues from land lord tenant actions to foreclosures and more. Real property rules are varied and complex, whether you are buying or selling real property or dealing with encroaching neighbors or government regulations. The advice of a highly qualified and experienced Attorney is highly beneficial and a must for anyone who wants to have peace of mind knowing their property is protected by properly prepared documentation and strong legal representation.
